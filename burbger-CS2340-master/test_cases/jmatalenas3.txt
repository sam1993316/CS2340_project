ID: 6.3.2 (M6, police (third NPC), flee (second action))
Description: Tests fleeing from police encounters, ensuring the player is able to run from the police when they have a sufficient pilot skill and testing that the player cannot run if not. Additionally, applies the correct consequences to fleeing.

This case specifically checks:
- if the player flees from the police successfully, that their inventory, health, etc. are unchanged
- if the player fails to flee from the police, that the items to confiscate are removed, they are fined, and their health depleted by the police's fighter skill
- the player's location unconditionally returns to where they were before the encounter and the player is unconditionally no longer in an encounter.

Pre-conditions:
    The player:
        exists,
        has items for the police to confiscate,
        has nonzero health the police can deplete (otherwise, game over),
        enters a police encounter when attempting to travel,
        attempts to flee from the encounter

Use case:
    The player's stats are checked against the police.
    The first skill check is in the situation where the player has a better pilot skill.
    The second, the player has an equal pilot skill.
    The third, the player has a lesser pilot skill.

Post-conditions:
    The player:
        exists,
        is in the region they attempted to travel from,
        is no longer in an encounter

Other notes:
      Make the encounter logic print out the stat block of the encountered NPC and compare with the player to check skill differences

Expected outcomes:
         If their pilot skill is greater (as in the first case):
            The player flees successfully:
                Their location is set to their previous location
                Their inventory, money, and health are unaffected

         If their pilot skill is lesser or equal (as in the second and third cases):
            The player fails to flee:
                Their location is set to their previous location
                The items the police want to confiscate are removed
                Their money is reduced by a random amount within the fine's bounds
                Their health is reduced by the police's fighter skill

Actual result:
       Successful check is correct, player's health is unchanged, no items are confiscated, no fine is incurred; the player ends up back in the expected region and exits the encounter
       Equal check is correct, same behavior as failed check, as expected
       Failed check is correct, player's health decreases, the correct number of items are confiscated, and a fine is incurred; the player ends up back in the expected region and exits the encounter

The application passes this test.
