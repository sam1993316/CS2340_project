It will test that the player cannot make a purchase without enough cargo space but with sufficient funds
And it will test both case concurrently as well

Traceability:
The M5 requirements specify that the player should not be able to purchase items without enough money and space

Effective Use Cases:
A player object must be made
It must have a vehicle with an inventory
It must be interacting with a market in a certain region

Actual Test Case:
Precondition: A player has been created on medium difficulty with 6 Merchant Skill Points, an Ant ship, has full health, fuel and 500 credits
Select the Akimiski region and Travel to it. If already in Akimiski do nothing
View the Market inventory
Select an item to purchase with the "Buy [item]" button
Note the price of the item and how much the credits change
Next buy the most expensive item available until the are not enough credits to buy the next item
Now attempt to buy the item
Assert that an "insufficient funds" warning was produced
Now buy the cheapest item until until there are not enough credits left to buy another
Now attempt to buy another
Again assert that an "insufficient funds" warning was produced
Sell all items in inventory
Select the Bahamas and travel to it
A cheap item such as stone or wood should be available
Purchase 10 of these items
Now try to buy one more item
Assert that an "insufficient cargo space" warning was produced


Expected Output:
The player will have enough feul to travel to Akimiski and the Akimiski market will be available
The player's feul will decrease by the amount specified when the user selects travel
The player will a discrete amount of items from the market. Then trying to buy another item will result in an error
The player's credits should reflect the amount of items purchased times the item price less than 500
The player will travel again with the feul reflecting the change
Now the player will purchase items until their inventory maxes out at 10 items
After every item the inventory will show an increase of 1
